Made my way through chapters 6 and 7. It was all about tables and forms today. Learned some useful things that I hadn't known about before. I think that I can use some of it for my sign up/dispatch project that's on hold right now. One of these days I will get back to making that project. 

I don't have much else to say today. Just happy that I can continue my coding journey. 
 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
