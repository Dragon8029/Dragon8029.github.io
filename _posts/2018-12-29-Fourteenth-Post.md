Continued on with the javaScript book. Today was spent working on the "events" chapter. I only made it part of the way through. The information is getting tougher to follow. I need to come up with some small projects to help hammer in what I am learning. Maybe I will spend some time doing that tomorrow. That will depend on if I have time to code. It will be a travel day.
