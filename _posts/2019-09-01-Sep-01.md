Since the last time I wrote here, I have worked on a todo list app (which I got partially done, and then ran into some troubles with things I couldn't resolve. I will tackle it again in the future.), I have started the #javascript30 challenge (done it before, but wanted the refresher), and started working on a small one page site for a friends business. 

I have been struggling with the one page site, but it's slowly coming together. I'm just tackling it one small thing at a time. Taking the wins or losses as they happen. It's a marathon not a sprint!

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
