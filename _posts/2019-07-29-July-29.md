It's been a couple days since I updated this blog.  We are back home now, we had a good time in Kamloops. I am extremely thankful that I was able to enjoy the 2nd week of the vacation.  Many thank to the specialist who was able to diagnose my issues and get me moving again. 

Today I decided to go back to the basics.  I had purchased a 2 book set a while ago (Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book, and his Javascript and jQuery book), and have never used the HTML & CSS one.  I figure since I need a refresher on almost everything, that I may as well start with the HTML & CSS book.  So far I have made it part way through Chapter 2.  I am typing out every one of the examples to help cement the learning.  It takes way longer, but I believe that it helps in the end. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
