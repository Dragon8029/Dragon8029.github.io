Today I sat down at my computer and was at a loss as to where to start.  So I looked up some things I had saved, and found one for creating a css grid calendar.  Completed it super quick as it was easy. 

Then I found one from Lighthouse Labs to build a chat app using javaScript. I built the basic portions, and will continue on building the extended portions.  I need to add the functionality for the users to enter their initials, and then have it say "CU says": or something similar before it puts what they type in. Also, there should be some sort of history for other users joining in on the chat. 

Doesn't feel like I have accomplished much today, but I think these refreshers are good. It's helping me get back into the swing of things and re-building the muscle memory. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
