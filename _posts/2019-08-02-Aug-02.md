Continued making my way through chapters 8 and 9 of Jon Duckett's HTML and CSS book. Covered lots of interesting things like video formats, flash, and how to incorporate them into a page. Along with Audio formats and how to get them on a page.

Also covered iframes and how to use them on a page. Lots of neat stuff. 

Next up is the CSS section. Can't wait to get started on that. It should be lots of fun.  

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
