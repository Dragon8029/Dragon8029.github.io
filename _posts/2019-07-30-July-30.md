Finished making my way through Chapter 2, and completed Chapter 3. Learned some new things with semantic markup, and about definition lists. I think some of this will come in hand in the future. 

I also got a freelance offer from someone on freelancer.com. I hope it's a legitimate offer. This may be a way for me to expand my portfolio and gain some real world experience. Kind of excited for the opportunity. 
 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
