Decided I needed a break from all the tutorials and what not, so I decided to start building a page for a friends company.
<br>
This will be a very basic site for now, but it will help to solidify some of the skills I have learned over the past while. 
<br>
I also signed up for stackoverflow, and did some Pluralsight assesments. My skills with HTML, Git and GitHub are all proficient.  My CSS and JavaScript skills were at a novice level. 
<br>
The JavaScript one did not suprise me, but I thought I would have done better on the CSS one.  Oh well, time to brush up on those skills.
