title: Platformer Game 
---

So far, the platformer game is coming along slowly. I haven't been watching the youtube video, I have just been looking at the code on git hub and typing it into VS Code. So far I have finished up parts 1 and 2. Both are working as they should. I am hoping to find some more time while I have days off to complete all seven parts of this..... We will see, life is busy.....
