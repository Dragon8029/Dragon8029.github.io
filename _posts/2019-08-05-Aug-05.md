Made my way through chapter 15 today. It was a tough go, there was lots of material to cover. It was all on Layout. Learned about positioning, divs, standard layout, etc...

I will have to practice all this once I finish the book. I'll have to think up some projects to do.

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
