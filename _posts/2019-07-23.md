It's been a long time since I added to my blog. Lots has happened. I continued coding almost every day until around the 10th of June, when some medical issues prevented me from being able to code. Then I lost my job, and ended up being bed ridden. I was in so much pain, it was unreal. I ended up traveling 14 hours (very painfully) to see a specialist. He gave me a diagnosis and treatment plan. After dealing with pain for months and months, this was a huge relief. Turns out that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, it's treatable, but will never completly go away. At least I will be able to function again. 

I have started to code again, just finding some simple tutorials and projects to refresh my memory. It's amazing how much you tend to forget when you don't use it everyday.
