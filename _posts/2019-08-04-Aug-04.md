Continued working through Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. Completed chapters 12, 13 and 14 today. Learned how to style text, boxes, lists, tables and forms. 

There was some styling that I have not come across previously, and I think it will fit in nice with the forms on my big Sign up/Sign in project. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
