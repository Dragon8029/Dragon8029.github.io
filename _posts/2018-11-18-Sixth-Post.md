title: JavaScript & jQuery
---

So...I have decided that I will continue making my way through 
**_JavaScript & jQuery by Jon Duckett_**. My plan will be to finish this book, and all the tutorials in it, before moving on to anything else. This should hopefully give me a little structure and prevent me from going down more rabbit holes....at least thats my hope. 
<br>
So far, I've just covered some of the basics. Covered *data types, arithmetic operators, operators, expressions, and arrays*. That brings me to chapter 3. Chapter 3 will be on Functions, Methods and Objects. 
<br>
Stay tuned for more on my journey.
