title: Distraction? 
---

It turns out..... That I am no good with keeping to a plan. I was going to work my way through Jon Duckett's javaScript and jQuery book from front to back withouth any distractions. It turns out that a tutorial to build a platformer style game (like Mario), can throw you off the rails. At least it is made using javaScript.  I am still bound and determined to become a developer and to master javaScript. It just might take me a while with these small interuptions.
