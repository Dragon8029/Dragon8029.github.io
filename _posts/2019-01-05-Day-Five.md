Settled back into the home/work routine after the holidays. I'm actually excited. This is the first week of my Monday to Friday shift. I'm hoping that means I will be able to code more consistantly. Working for 10 days straight was getting to be a drag. <br>
Since my last update I have completed chapter 6, and moved on to chapter 7. Learning about jQuery now. I still need to think of some things to build so I can practice what I am learning. <br>
I may go back through the book and make some small projects for each section. If anyone has any suggestions, I am open to ideas.
