I am very thankful that I am here to write this right now. Travelling back from holidays with my family, we lost control of our car and went off a twenty foot embankment. Luckliy we all walked away with no injuries. <br>
With that being said, I haven't coded in a few days, but I'm back at it now. <br>
I have continued on where I left off in chapter 6, it's all about event's. There are some really cool things you can do with events to control what happens on a page. I will need to come up with some projects and start using what I am learning.
