Ok, so this morning I was having some troubles getting motivated and finding something to do. I thought I had some more lessons to finish up the Lighthouse labs javascript tutorials, but I finished what they had yesterday. I could attempt to play with the code and try to figure out how to get the app to work the way it should, maybe I will tackle that later. 

I found a calculator tutorial that I decided to try out. I managed to get a good way through it, but then got stumped at the function to actually get it to calculate values. It wasn't clear in the tutorial where the code should be placed in the file. I will try to figure it out, but without the source code, I'm not sure how much luck I will have. 

That's it for today I think, I may try to find some more tutorials to try so that I don't have to search them up in the morning. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
