# Migration

Between yesterday and today i have managed to move a couple of old projects to GitHub. One of those projects was my portolio page from freeCodeCamp. I have started to update it with my complete projects. 
<br>
Because some of the code was broken, I've had to spend some time fixing it to make everything work correctly again. 
<br>
I've also decided to stop attempt 4 of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I felt too guilty for not being able to code everyday, and having breaks that were longer than 1 or 2 days.  I will still continue to code as much as I possibly can. And if I feel that I can make the challenge work later on, I will give it another shot.
