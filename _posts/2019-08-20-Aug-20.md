It's been a little while since I last wrote anything here. I've been spending a good couple hours a day going through Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book. It's an amazing resource. This was my second time going through it, and I'm sure that I will go through it several more times in the near future. 

Today I decided it was time to start building my own things from scratch, so I decided to start off with a todo list app. So far I have the basics done. But i did run into a problem where everytime I press the enter key, the page refreshes. I need to figure out what's causing that, and get it to add the content of the input to the list when enter is pushed.  I'm done for today, but will come back to it tomorrow with a fresh brain. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
