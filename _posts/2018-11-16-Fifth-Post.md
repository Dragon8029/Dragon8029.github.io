Well, after yesterday's post, and not much motivation to tackle anything I have been working on. I decided to tackle the free Lighthouse Labs javascript course/tutorial. 
<br>
I managed to complete most of the course, but got stumped on the last couple of challenges. Actually it's the first one of four that has me stumped. I need to somehow get the Initials of the person who created the message to show up beside the message they type. So down another rabbit hole I go....
<br>
I found a simple chat app on Medium that uses socket.io, I have completed it, and am hoping that I can use some of the techniques to make the Lighthouse Labs chat app work the way it's supposed to. Then I will be able to move on to the next three challenges.
