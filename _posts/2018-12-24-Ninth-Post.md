It's been a while since I last posted. Just about a month. **OOPS**.  Life's been busy, and I've felt a little bit tired. It's tough living up north when you go to work in the dark and come home in the dark.  I've been trying to get as much coding in as I can. I completed the 4th stage of the mario style game, however I ran into problems on the 5th and 6th stages. So far I have been unsuccessful at solving the issues, I'm sure I will one day. I have also continued on with Jon Duckett's book on JavaScript and jQuery. It's a good book and is a good tool. I'm trying to stick with it.  I have also found a Neural Net course for free that is interesting. So I have been checking that out.
