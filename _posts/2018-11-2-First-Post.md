title: First Post!

This is my first blog post.  
Today i decided that instead of following a whole bunch of tutorials, I would work on creating a blog using github pages and Jekyll. 
I am also going to work on creating a portfolio site on github pages, as it seems to be the best place to build one for free.  

This coding journey has been difficult, but also very rewarding.  I am amazed to see how connected the community is, and am glad to be a part of it in some small way.
