It's been a little while since my last post.  I haven't had a lot of time to work on coding, but I try to get in what I can.  
<br>
I kind of fell into a rabbit hole, and need to figure out how to proceed.  I am currently struggling with learning JavaScript, so I found a couple of Web Development Bootcamps that have some free pre-bootcamp prep courses.  I started one from Fullstack Acadamy, but I don't know if I should continue with it, carry on with freeCodeCamp (I feel I struggle with understanding it from here), or try a new one.  There are far too many choices.
<br>
Stay tuned, I will post my decision eventually.....
