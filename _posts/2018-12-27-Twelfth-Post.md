Still working through the **javaScript** book. I'm currenty on Chapter 5, working with the DOM (Document Object Model). This is a fairly big chapter. <br>
Finding it a bit difficult to concentrate, but I'm forcing myself to get some more time in. I really want to learn this and have it cemented into my brain. <br>
Went back and tried to figure out what isn't working for the platformer style game. I'm at a loss. I copied all the original code, and it still is not working. I'm not sure what's wrong. I will try to debug it at a later date.
