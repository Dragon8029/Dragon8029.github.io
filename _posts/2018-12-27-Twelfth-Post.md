Still working through the **javaScript** book. I'm currenty on Chapter 5, working with the DOM (Document Object Model). This is a fairly big chapter. <br>
Finding it a bit difficult to concentrate, but I'm forcing myself to get some more time in. I really want to learn this and have it cemented into my brain.
