Been a few days since I've updated my blog. Since my last post I have started Jon Duckett's Javascript & Jquery book. Completed chapters 1 - 4 and made it part way through chapter 5 so far. 

I have completed this book before, I am just going through it again as a refresher since I was not able to code for a couple months. I did have to take the 9th off from coding due to my arthritis. I was able to see a doctor quickly, and got a steroid shot, so I'm back at it today. 

Until next time, **Keep Coding!**
